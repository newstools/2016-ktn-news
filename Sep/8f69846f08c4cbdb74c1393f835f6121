A teenage mother in a small village in Bungoma county claims she is now being shunned after reports that her 4 month old baby speaks. Nineteen year old Salome Wangila says the baby girl has been heard to speak in Kiswahili. However, other than the mother and the babyâ€™s grandmother, no one else has been reported to hear the baby speak.
